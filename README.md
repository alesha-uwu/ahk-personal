### ahk-wasd-to-move

  Let's you control the mouse by using the keyboard. It's not actually wasd to move the mouse. It's i (up), j(left), k(down), and l(right) to move the mouse and it's z (left click), x (middle mouse click), and c (right click) to click the mouse.
  
  Change the distance (currently either 8 or -8 in the code) to change the speed of movement (larger number is faster movement)
